# Modeling and Design of a Finite State Machine-Based Traffic Signal Controller for Efficient Urban Traffic Management

This project introduces a Finite State Machine (FSM)-based traffic signal controller aimed at improving urban traffic efficiency and pedestrian safety. The controller dynamically adjusts traffic signals using real-time data, optimizing the flow of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections. The FSM model includes multiple traffic light states, accounting for factors such as vehicle detection, pedestrian crossing requests, and adaptive timing mechanisms. The proposed system enhances traffic control by reducing congestion, improving response times, and ensuring better road safety through an IoT-enabled approach. Simulation results validate its effectiveness in managing real-world traffic scenarios.
